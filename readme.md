<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Jafran ðŸ––</h1>

### I'm a FullStack Web Application Software Developer and work for [WPPOOL](https://www.wppool.dev) as *Senior Software Engineer*.

### I am not a very hard-working person, can not waste more time than it needs. I just find the easiest and perfect solution to a problem. Unlike a donkey who works all day and nothing comes out, I prefer working smartly. Neither am I a selfless person nor a man without a personal life. I just keep balances. I make mistakes, take wrong decisions, but I learn from the mistakes I made. 
 
### I still solve problems with JavaScript and PHP, promot clean and contemporary software architecture. I have published projects on `NPM`, `Packagist`, `WordPress` and `Shopify appstore` as open-source program. I believe, coding is science and science should be free.
